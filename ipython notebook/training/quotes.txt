If you do not know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else.
If you can dream it, then you can achieve it. You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want. 
Not all those who wander are lost.

Life is all about balance. You do not always need to be getting stuff done. Sometimes it is perfectly okay, and absolutely necessary, to shut down, kick back, and do nothing.

Take rest; a field that has rested gives a bountiful crop.
I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want?

You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.

Know, first, who you are, and then adorn yourself accordingly.
The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes “Awww!”.
The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it – basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.
Don't bend; do not water it down; do not try to make it logical; do not edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.
Always go with the choice that scares you the most, because that is the one that is going to help you grow.
To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best day and night to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.

Re-examine all that you have been told… dismiss that which insults your soul.
No legacy is so rich as honesty.

If you take responsibility for yourself you will develop a hunger to accomplish your dreams.

It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit. 
Whatever you think you can do or believe you can do, begin it. Action has magic, grace and power in it.

If you care enough for a result, you will most certainly attain it.
Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results.

No matter what challenges or setbacks and disappointments you may encounter along the way, you will find true success and happiness if you have only one goal. There really is only one.
